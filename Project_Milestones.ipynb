    "1) A decent amount more of the paper has been completed after a collaboration of contribution. Weâ€™ve also gotten a model trained and uploaded the results to GitHub on Friday. We had to hand label more data to use for validation and testing over the weekend so we in the process of making it so the network can read in the data and split it into training, validation, and test sets. Currently, we have something that works right now but what we're hoping to do is have that simple CNN and then build a second one thatâ€™s the same but uses transfer learning like they did in our main source for our journal article. We're doing this so we can have more intriacate results because this will allow us to make comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Even though in our last milestone we said that our paper would have been largely written, we were unable to make a large amount of progress on it. This is because we had to hand-label our data and our decision to build a second model that utilizes transfer learning. While this is a setback, these decisions of ours will hopefully allow us to write a better methodology section that will precede a more detailed results section. Other than that, we wish we could have written more of the paper, but we will be doing so as soon as the code is done and well-written.\n",

Also, we have finished the entirety of the the code (although we still may go back and tweak various things just to be safe), The code was completed early for the same reasons as the demo was.
